This Excel file converts Nexa codes (House code and Unit code as defined in e.g. Telldus Live) to Base64 codes for direct use with Broadlink universal remotes.
It can also batch generate a 'BroadlinkNexaCustomSwitches.txt' file for inclusion in Home Assistant to set up custom switches.
You may need to create a folder C:\Personal\Nexa for this (or modify the Visual Basic code to point to some other directory)
